# Trip Overlay Rewrite TODO

## Problem Analysis

The current React implementation has fundamental issues with trip progress tracking compared to the original vanilla JS version from commit `74fe22f`. The core problem is that distance tracking logic has been overcomplicated and fragmented across multiple React hooks, leading to bugs in progress calculation and state management.

## Key Issues Identified

### 1. Distance Tracking Bug

- **Problem**: `tripStore.ts` uses `currentDistanceKm` for progress calculation instead of `totalTraveledKm`
- **Original**: Used `totalDistanceTraveled` correctly for progress bar
- **Impact**: Progress bar doesn't advance properly as distance is accumulated

### 2. Overcomplicated State Management

- **Problem**: Original had simple `appState` object, React version has fragmented state across multiple stores/hooks
- **Original**: Single source of truth with direct property access
- **Impact**: Harder to debug, sync issues between different state pieces

### 3. Missing Core GPS Logic

- **Problem**: Original robust GPS validation and distance accumulation logic fragmented
- **Original**: Centralized location processing with proper validation
- **Impact**: GPS processing less reliable, harder to maintain

### 4. Architecture Mismatch

- **Problem**: React version tried to be "too React-like" and lost simplicity
- **Original**: Straightforward event-driven architecture
- **Impact**: More complex, more prone to bugs, harder to debug

## Rewrite Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Logic Restoration âœ… COMPLETED

- [x] Port exact GPS processing logic from original vanilla JS
- [x] Implement single state management that mirrors original `appState`
- [x] Restore proper distance accumulation and validation
- [x] Maintain exact same movement detection algorithm

### Phase 2: State Management Simplification âœ… COMPLETED

- [x] Create single context/store that matches original structure
- [x] Use `totalDistanceTraveled` for progress calculations
- [x] Implement proper localStorage persistence like original
- [x] Ensure state updates trigger UI re-renders correctly

### Phase 3: React Integration âœ… COMPLETED

- [x] Keep React minimal - only for UI rendering
- [x] Port console commands API exactly as original
- [x] Maintain URL parameter compatibility
- [x] Preserve all existing functionality

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS

- [ ] Test distance tracking with demo mode
- [ ] Verify console commands work identically
- [ ] Confirm GPS processing matches original behavior
- [ ] Test localStorage persistence

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Single State Hook

```typescript
const useTripOverlay = () => {
  const [state, setState] = useState({
    totalDistanceTraveled: 0, // Main distance for progress bar
    todayDistanceTraveled: 0, // Today's distance
    originalTotalDistance: 371, // Vienna to Zagreb
    lastPosition: null,
    currentMode: 'STATIONARY',
    useImperialUnits: false,
    // ... exact same structure as original appState
  });

  // Direct port of original functions
  const processLocationUpdate = data => {
    /* exact original logic */
  };
  const addDistance = km => {
    /* exact original logic */
  };

  return { state, processLocationUpdate, addDistance };
};
```

### 2. Core Principles

- **Port, don't rewrite** - Keep working algorithms exactly as they were
- **Single source of truth** - One state object like original
- **Minimal React** - Use React only for UI, not business logic
- **Preserve APIs** - Console commands and URL parameters work identically
- **Test thoroughly** - Especially distance tracking in demo mode

### 3. Benefits of Fresh Rewrite

- **Eliminate migration errors** - No risk of logic bugs from translation
- **Preserve working logic** - Keep exact GPS processing that worked
- **Simpler debugging** - Single source of truth for state
- **Better performance** - Less React overhead, more direct updates
- **Easier maintenance** - Less complex architecture

## Files to Modify

### Core Implementation

- [ ] `src/hooks/useTripOverlay.ts` - New single hook for all trip logic
- [ ] `src/TripOverlay.tsx` - Simplified component using new hook
- [ ] `src/utils/globalConsoleAPI.ts` - Update to use new hook

### Remove/Consolidate

- [ ] `src/store/tripStore.ts` - Replace with single state hook
- [ ] `src/hooks/useTripProgress.ts` - Merge into main hook
- [ ] `src/hooks/useGPSProcessor.ts` - Merge into main hook

### Test Files

- [ ] Create test for distance tracking accuracy
- [ ] Create test for console commands
- [ ] Create test for GPS processing

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Progress bar advances correctly as distance is traveled
- [ ] Console commands work exactly like original
- [ ] GPS processing filters noise and validates movement
- [ ] Demo mode shows realistic distance accumulation
- [ ] State persists correctly in localStorage
- [ ] All URL parameters function as documented

## Timeline

- **Day 1**: Core logic restoration and single state implementation
- **Day 2**: React integration and console commands
- **Day 3**: Testing and validation
- **Day 4**: Final polishing and documentation updates

## Notes

The key insight is that the original vanilla JS implementation worked correctly. The React migration introduced complexity without benefit and broke core functionality. By starting fresh with a focus on preserving the working logic while adding minimal React UI, we can create a more reliable and maintainable solution.

The motto for this rewrite: **"Port the logic, React the UI"**
