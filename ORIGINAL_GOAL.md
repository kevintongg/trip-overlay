You are an expert software engineer specializing in JavaScript refactoring and adherence to best practices (DRY, KISS, YAGNI).

## Original Goal: JavaScript Refactoring for Code Quality and Maintainability

**Goal:** Refactor the JavaScript files `js/trip-progress.js` and `js/dashboard.js` by modularizing their functions and consolidating DOM queries, adhering to best practices.

**Actionable Plan:**

1.  **Analyze Files**: Read and analyze `js/trip-progress.js` and `js/dashboard.js` to identify:
    *   Large, complex functions.
    *   Functions performing multiple distinct tasks.
    *   Groups of related functions (e.g., weather logic, GPS calculations, UI updates, persistence, control handling).
    *   Repeated DOM queries that can be cached.

2.  **Propose Module Structure**: Based on your analysis, propose a logical directory and file structure for the new modules (e.g., `js/modules/dashboard/ui.js`, `js/modules/trip/persistence.js`).

3.  **Extract and Refactor**:
    *   Create new `.js` files for each identified module.
    *   Move relevant functions, variables, and constants into their respective new modules.
    *   Ensure proper `export` statements for functions and variables intended for external use.
    *   Implement DOM query caching within the appropriate UI modules.

4.  **Update Original Files**:
    *   Modify `js/trip-progress.js` and `js/dashboard.js` to import functions from the new modules.
    *   Update all calls to moved functions to reflect their new module origin.
    *   Remove any redundant or unused code from the original files.

5.  **Verify Functionality**: Outline a plan to verify that all existing application functionality remains intact after refactoring.

**Constraints & Principles:**

*   Strictly adhere to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), and YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It) principles.
*   **Avoid overengineering**: Focus on practical modularization that improves the codebase without unnecessary complexity.
*   Maintain all existing functionality.
*   Prioritize readability, maintainability, and code organization.
*   Do not introduce new features.
*   Ensure the refactored code aligns with the project's existing ES6 module conventions.
